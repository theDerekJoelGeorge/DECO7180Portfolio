                        <h2 class="pt2">Overview</h2>
                        <p class="justify">In Week 1 of our studio sessions, we were presented with datasets from 3 sources namely Brisbane City Council, Australian Broadcasting Company and
                            State Library of Queensland. We were asked to select a certain dataset and develop an interesting product using the selected dataset. This idea was to be pitched to the 
                            class in the format of an a3 sized poster during Week 3. <br><br>
                            For my poster, I decided to use the <b>Indigenous Languages Map Data</b> dataset present on the State Library of Queensland website. <br><br>
                            <b>The Indigenous Echo</b> is designed to provide an echo into the rich linguistic history of the Indigenous regions of Queensland. It allows users to select various regions on the map of Queensland and gain 
                            an understanding of the language spoken by the Indigenous community who occupy/occupied that region. <br><br>
                            The slideshow below showcases the <b>Logo</b> that I had designed (Slide 1), <b>Poster</b> (Slide 2) and the <b>High Fidelity Prototypes</b> made on Figma (Slides 3,4,5,6,7)

                        <p class="justify">As an International Student, I was amazed by the cultural importance that UQ gives to the Indigenous and Aboriginal communities. So on coming across this dataset,
                            I decided to try and design it to be a learning platform to understand the rich heritage of Queenslands past.<br><br>
                            Though I believe that this was a good experience to unleash our creativity, I think that it would have been better to do this, while being part of the team that you would form in Week 5.

                    <h1>PART B: TEAM CHARTER</h1>
                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p class="justify">In Week 4 and 5, we were asked to form teams amidst students from the studio. These teams would then go ahead and develop a functional prototype of a unique approach of showcasing the use of data using an API.<br><br>
                            Considering all the conditions put forward by the tutoring team, we formed team Lorem Ipsum during Week 5. The name <b>"Lorem Ipsum"</b> <i>(suggested by me)</i> was initially selected to be a placeholder, since at the point, we had not decided with an idea for our application. Later on, we just stuck with the name.<br><br>
                            Following this, we decided to meet every Tuesday as well as set up a WhatsApp groupchat and a Discord channel to provide constant communication amidst the team. A GitHub repository was also made to ensure code collaboration.<br><br>
                            The role that I wanted to play this project was that of a <i>Jack of All Trades</i>, ie play a part in all stages of the development process as well as the presentation. I had little to zero knowledge of web development but believed I could learn as well as contribute with my 
                            skils across the design field.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Reflections</h2>
                        <p class="justify">I was initially worried about forming teams since I did not know anyone in my studio. This made me move out of my comfort zone to interact with people, in an attempt to find team mates.<br><br>
                        An ideal team would consist of a documentor, back-end developer, front-end developer and a designer. In Lorem Ipsum, though we assigned certain roles to each other, we were all flexible with our roles and often took up work that was
                        to be done by another. This helped set up a learning environment, which I believe is supposed to be a goal of this course. In my case, I was designated to be the lead documentor, but I got involved in certain development aspects as well as 
                        the design.<br><br>
                        The only concern I had regarding the team formation, would be for the tutors to set "Being a Backend Developer" as a criteria for team composition. This course would have been significantly harder if I was meant to learn everything from the ground up and implement it, over the limited time we were given.
                        </p>

                    <h1>PART C: DESIGN PROPOSAL</h1>
                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p class="justify">Post Week 5, we were required to refine and further develop a specific concept into a clear and coherent design for development over the remainder of the semester. This concept 
                            was to be pitched infront of the class in Week 6.<br><br>
                            Upon reviewing each others posters, we came to a conclusion that the concepts were either similar to pre-existing applications or too difficult to develop over the timeframe alloted to us. This made us
                            brainstorm a unique idea for which we prepared a presentation and mockups to present it to the studio.
                        </p>
                        <h2>My Contribution</h2>
                        <p class="justify">
                            We were all tasked with finding unique ideas and decided to pitch them amidst ourselves so that we could select the best ones. My suggestions included:<br>
                            <ul class="left">
                                <li>A Barbeque Booking System</li>
                                <li>A Weed/Pest finder game along the lines of Where's Waldo</li>
                                <li>A Pothole/Road works alert app for cyclists and runners </li>
                            </ul><br>
                            We decided to proceed with the idea of a Barbeque Booking System since it would provide us with a range of versatility in using multiple datasets.

                            <b>The Idea behind BBQueue</b>
                        </p>
                        <p class="justify mt2">
                            A research by Jennifer J Argo, showed that effective brand names enhance consumer awareness which often created a favorable image for the product (Argo et al, 2010). As a result, I spent quite a bit of time
                            in trying to find a perfect name for our application that would align with our objectives. The name BBQueue fit perfectly since it is a catchy word-play between Barbequing and about how we aim to get users to stop spending time in a Queue.

                            Being the Lead Documentor, I was incharge of curating content as well as making the presentation.

                            I created a theme that all the presentations across our pitches
                            would follow. The grilling sausage of the logo would have a different color on each slide indicating the progression of the presentation.<br>

                            <b class="left mt2">The Positives</b><br><br>
                            We were able to put forth a great idea during our design proposal and the tutors really enjoyed our presentation. The unique aspect of our project was certainly the integration 
                            of the weather API where the users recieve forecasts on dates that they wish to book. We were very optimistic with our ideas and features and raised the bar of expectations.<br><br>
                            <b class="left">The Negatives</b><br><br>
                            Though we were given a weeks time to prepare a concrete presentation, we finalized the idea of BBQueue, a day prior to our pitch. This was mainly due to lack of communication
                            amidst the team members as well as the difficulty in finding an idea that would set us apart from everyone else. 
                            This was a huge downfall and caused a lot of panic for me since I was incharge of a presentation for which I had no content for until the previous night.<br><br>
                            A suggestion would be to provide a bit more time for this stage of the course since a weeks time is not enough unless you select an idea that one of the team members had pitched for their poster.

                            We had 3 weeks to prepare a Minimum Viable Product for BBQueue. This was required to showcase the the key technical/interactive features, of our website, along with any developments to the original design, submitted during Part C: Design Proposal.<br>
                            To be ahead on schedule, we decided to allocate work quickly and try to implement half the project by the deadline. This saw us meet frequently, have continuous communication on the discord channel as well as

                            For our MVP, we were able to develop the complete homepage with a functioning map, and Park Listing as well as a partial Booking Page that displayed the information about the Park.

                        <p class="justify">
                           I took up the responsibility of integrating the Map functionality using Leaflet API. The Map was meant to display the BBQ locations as well as have popups that allow users
                            to view details as well as move onto the booking page.<br><br>
                            I made use of the official documentation provided by Leaflet (<a href="https://leafletjs.com/">link</a>), notes from the workshops as well as a few Youtube videos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaABCCKf97c&ab_channel=GeoDev">User Position</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls_Eue1xUtY&list=PLyWyQBSWLw1NH1wsA0wkSMTlQ45P0AqCj&ab_channel=GeoDev">Leaflet</a>) as tutorials to work on my part. <br><br>
                            Though we initially planned to make use of Google Maps API, I decided to proceed with Leaflet since it was free and did not require any API keys. Tile Layers allow you to add a custom look to the map provided by Leaflet. I found a Google Maps Tile Layer (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9394190/leaflet-map-api-with-google-satellite-layer">link</a>) which I used since it provided significantly more information to the user 
                            as compared to the default leaflet map.

                            In comparison to the design proposal presentation, we were ahead of schedule and completed about 60% of our project by the time of the MVP presentation. The only thing remaining was the booking functionality and weather API integration. I was done with most of my assigned work and hence recieved time to focus on other courses.<br><br>
                            I was able to learn about Leaflet.js as well as put into practice my knowledge from the DECO7140 course.<br><br>

                            Our grades recieved for this section did not justify the efforts that was put in by us. Unlike the Design proposal where we were unable to finish the presentation, we were able to finish the presentation in this case, but at the cost of rushing through the whole thing, leaving out multiple details we could have mentioned.<br><br>
                            Another issue was the lack of clarity in what an Interaction Plan was meant to be. I understood that everyone was marked down heavily and believe that there should have been a session regarding what was expected from an Interaction Plan.

                    <p class="justify">
                        We had 5 weeks to complete working on the final prototype of BBQueue. Alongside this, we were also required to design and produce an a3 color poster that showcases our application as well as submit a digital report that summarizes our application.<br><br>

                        The map still required quite a bit of work post the MVP presentation. I decided to customize the user icon, integrate the filter functionality into the map as well as provide more information related to the BBQ location in the popups.<br><br>
                        To add in buttons to the map, I made use of Easy Button plugin (<a href="http://danielmontague.com/projects/easyButton.js/v1/examples/">link</a>) as well as Font Awesome iconpack (<a href="https://fontawesome.com/">link</a>) to be used as the icons of the buttons

                        The Tradeshow was the best opportunity for us to gain an insight into the user experience of our application by allowing our fellow classmates and tutors to test BBQueue. To gather information, I created a questionnaire using Google Forms, whose results have been compiled in the final report.<br><br>
                        I also designed and printed out Badges that we wore on the day of the tradeshow as well as a card that users recieved post leaving a review.<br><br>

                        We were almost 60-70% done by the time of the MVP presentation, hence development of the final product was a bit more relaxed.As a result, we were able to put out almost all the features that we had initially presented during our design proposal. <br><br>
                        Our demo was well recieved by everyone who tested it and it was satisfying to see that our hardwork had paid off. <br><br>

                        We were unable to conduct the user testing amidst the number of users that we were expecting, since there were very less people who came over to our stall.<br><br>
                        Icons for the filters were not perfectly in-line with the criteria it was meant to represent. This is due to the fact that I had used the free version of the Font Awesome iconpack as opposed to the paid one.<br><br>
                        The Map should have considered using an "AND" condition while filtering while I used an "OR" condition to filter out locations. This was one of the feedback that we recieved. <br><br>

                    <h1>COURSE TAKEAWAYS</h1>
                        <h2>Expectations</h2>
                        <p class="justify">Upon registering for this course, I was intrigued by the prospect of developing an application from scratch. I decided to do DECO7140 in parallel to this course, so I was already sure that I would 
                            have to work twice as hard to not fall behind or prove to be a burden on my teammates. I was also initially daunted by the formation of teams since I thought that my lack of experience in web development would put me at 
                            a disadvantage as compared to others.<br><br>
                            My expectations for this course was to come out with the practical exposure of working on a web-development project as well as expose myself to collaboration in a team environment.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Learning Experience</h2>
                        <p class="justify">I was initially worried about forming teams since I did not know anyone in my studio. This made me move out of my comfort zone to interact with people, in an attempt to find team mates.<br><br>
                        An ideal team would consist of a documentor, back-end developer, front-end developer and a designer. In Lorem Ipsum, though we assigned certain roles to each other, we were all flexible with our roles and often took up work that was
                        to be done by another. This helped set up a learning environment, which I believe is supposed to be a goal of this course. In my case, I was designated to be the lead documentor, but I got involved in certain development aspects as well as 
                        the design.<br><br>
                        The only concern I had regarding the team formation, would be for the tutors to set "Being a Backend Developer" as a criteria for team composition. This course would have been significantly harder if I was meant to 
                        learn everything from the ground up and implement it, over the limited time we were given.

                        The only concern I had regarding the team formation, would be for the tutors to set "Being a Backend Developer" as a criteria for team composition. This course would have been significantly harder if I was meant to 
                        learn everything from the ground up and implement it, over the limited time we were given.
