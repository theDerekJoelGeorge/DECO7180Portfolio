                        <h2 class="pt2">Overview</h2>
                        <p class="justify">In Week 1 of our studio sessions, we were presented with datasets from 3 sources namely Brisbane City Council, Australian Broadcasting Company and
                            State Library of Queensland. We were asked to select a certain dataset and develop an interesting product using the selected dataset. This idea was to be pitched to the 
                            class in the format of an a3 sized poster during Week 3. <br><br>
                            For my poster, I decided to use the <b>Indigenous Languages Map Data</b> dataset present on the State Library of Queensland website. <br><br>
                            <b>The Indigenous Echo</b> is designed to provide an echo into the rich linguistic history of the Indigenous regions of Queensland. It allows users to select various regions on the map of Queensland and gain 
                            an understanding of the language spoken by the Indigenous community who occupy/occupied that region. <br><br>
                            The slideshow below showcases the <b>Logo</b> that I had designed (Slide 1), <b>Poster</b> (Slide 2) and the <b>High Fidelity Prototypes</b> made on Adobe Photoshop (Slides 3,4,5,6,7).

                        <p class="justify">As an International Student, I was amazed by the cultural importance that UQ gives to the Indigenous and Aboriginal communities. So on coming across this dataset,
                            I decided to try and design it to be a learning platform to understand the rich heritage of Queenslands past.<br><br>
                            Though I believe that this was a good experience to unleash our creativity, I think that it would have been better to do this, while being part of the team that you would form in Week 5.

                    <h1>PART B: TEAM CHARTER</h1>
                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p class="justify">In Week 4 and 5, we were asked to form teams amidst students from the studio. These teams would then go ahead and develop a functional prototype of a unique approach of showcasing the use of data using an API.<br><br>
                            Considering all the conditions put forward by the tutoring team, we formed team Lorem Ipsum during Week 5. The name <b>"Lorem Ipsum"</b> <i>(suggested by me)</i> was initially selected to be a placeholder, since at the point, we had not decided with an idea for our application. Later on, we simply decided to stick with the name.<br><br>
                            Following this, we decided to meet every Tuesday as well as set up a WhatsApp groupchat and a Discord channel to provide constant communication amidst the team. A GitHub repository was also made to ensure code collaboration.<br><br>
                            The role that I wanted to play this project was that of a <i>Jack of All Trades</i>, ie play a part in all stages of the development process as well as the presentation. I had little to zero knowledge of web development but believed I could learn as well as contribute with my 
                            skils across the design field.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Reflections</h2>
                        <p class="justify">I was initially worried about forming teams since I did not know anyone in my studio. This made me move out of my comfort zone to interact with people, in an attempt to find team mates.<br><br>
                        An ideal team would consist of a documentor, back-end developer, front-end developer and a designer. In Lorem Ipsum, though we assigned certain roles to each other, we were all flexible with our roles and often took up work that was
                        to be done by another. This helped set up a learning environment, which I believe is supposed to be a goal of this course. In my case, I was designated to be the lead documentor, but I got involved in certain development aspects as well as 
                        the design.<br><br>
                        The only concern I had regarding the team formation, would be for the tutors to set "Being a Backend Developer" as a criteria for team composition. This course would have been significantly harder if I was meant to learn everything from the ground up and implement it, over the limited time we were given.
                        </p>

                    <h1>PART C: DESIGN PROPOSAL</h1>
                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p class="justify">Post Week 5, we were required to refine and further develop a specific concept into a clear and coherent design for development over the remainder of the semester. This concept 
                            was to be pitched infront of the class in Week 6.<br><br>
                            Upon reviewing each others posters, we came to a conclusion that the concepts were either similar to pre-existing applications or too difficult to develop over the timeframe alloted to us. This made us
                            brainstorm a unique idea for which we prepared a presentation and mockups to present it to the studio.
                        </p>
                        <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                        <h3 class="left">Ideation</h3>
                        <p class="justify">
                            We were all tasked with finding unique ideas and decided to pitch them amidst ourselves so that we could select the best ones. My suggestions included:<br>
                            <ul class="left">
                                <li>A Barbeque Booking System</li>
                                <li>A Weed/Pest finder game along the lines of Where's Waldo</li>
                                <li>A Pothole/Road works alert app for cyclists and runners </li>
                            </ul><br>
                            We decided to proceed with the idea of a Barbeque Booking System since it would provide us with a range of versatility in using multiple datasets.

                        </p>
                        <h3 class="left">Developing the Name and Logo</h3>
                        <p class="justify">
                            According to Chiranjeev Kohli, <i>"The brand
                                name is an essential part of the brand image, the anchor for its positioning. While the image
                                associated with a brand name can be built with advertising and over time, brand managers realize
                                that a carefully created and chosen name can bring inherent strength to the brand."</i> (Kohli, C., & LaBahn,1997). As a result, I spent quite a bit of time
                            in trying to find a perfect name for our application that would align with our objectives.<br><br>
                            The name <b>BBQueue </b>fit perfectly since it is a catchy word-play between Barbequing and about how we aim to get users to stop spending time in a Queue.

                            Talking about the final logo, the <b>Grilling Fork, the Sausage and the Barbeque grill</b> elements signify the main factor behing BBQueue being Barbeques. The <b>Roman numerals combined with the circular shape of the grill</b> form a Clock symbolizing the Time aspect of BBQueue where you are able to skip Queues by making reservations.
                            <b>The Magnifying Glass</b> that is formed with the handle of the grilling fork and the grill highlights the Search functionality present in BBQueue. The color scheme of our application was selected in a way that reminds users of the key elements of a Barbeque, being a <i>shade of red for Ketchup, a shade of yellow/orange for 
                            mustard and a shade of brown to signify the cooked item</i>.

                            We were able to put forth a great idea during our design proposal and the tutors really enjoyed our presentation. The unique aspect of our project was certainly the integration 
                            of the weather API where the users recieve forecasts on dates that they wish to book. We were very optimistic with our ideas and features and raised the bar of expectations.<br><br>
                            <b class="left">The Negatives</b><br><br>
                            Though we were given a weeks time to prepare a concrete presentation, we finalized the idea of BBQueue, a day prior to our pitch. This was mainly due to lack of communication
                            amidst the team members as well as the difficulty in finding an idea that would set us apart from everyone else. 
                            This was a huge downfall and caused a lot of panic for me since I was incharge of a presentation for which I had no content for until the previous night.<br><br>
                            A suggestion would be to provide a bit more time for this stage of the course since a weeks time is not enough unless you select an idea that one of the team members had pitched for their poster.

                            We had 3 weeks to prepare a Minimum Viable Product for BBQueue. This was required to showcase the the key technical/interactive features, of our website, along with any developments to the original design, submitted during Part C: Design Proposal.<br>
                            To be ahead on schedule, we decided to allocate work quickly and try to implement half the project by the deadline. This saw us meet frequently, have continuous communication on the discord channel as well as 
                            work around the clock to achieve our goals.

                        <p class="justify">
                           I took up the responsibility of integrating the Map functionality using Leaflet API. The Map was meant to display the BBQ locations as well as have popups that allow users
                            to view details as well as move onto the booking page.<br><br>
                            I made use of the official documentation provided by Leaflet (<a href="https://leafletjs.com/" title="Official Leaflet Documentation">Visit Reference</a>), notes from the workshops as well as a few Youtube videos (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaABCCKf97c&ab_channel=GeoDev" title="Video by GeoDev on Youtube to get User Position">User Position</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ls_Eue1xUtY&list=PLyWyQBSWLw1NH1wsA0wkSMTlQ45P0AqCj&ab_channel=GeoDev " title="Video by GeoDev on Youtube about the basics of Leaflet">Basics of Leaflet</a>) as tutorials to work on my part. <br><br>
                            Though we initially planned to make use of Google Maps API, I decided to proceed with Leaflet since it was free and did not require any API keys. Tile Layers allow you to add a custom look to the map provided by Leaflet. I found a Google Maps Tile Layer (<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9394190/leaflet-map-api-with-google-satellite-layer" title="Google Maps Tile Layer for Leaflet">Visit Reference</a>) which I used since it provided significantly more information to the user 
                            as compared to the default leaflet map.

I had based this design off the figma prototype that was developed by my teammate.

                            The only change was to the cover slide which I designed on Adobe Photoshop.

                            In comparison to the design proposal presentation, we were ahead of schedule and completed about 60% of our project by the time of the MVP presentation. The only thing remaining was the booking functionality and weather API integration. I was done with most of my assigned work and hence recieved time to focus on other courses.<br><br>
                            I was able to learn about Leaflet.js as well as put into practice my knowledge from the DECO7140 course.<br><br>

                            Our grades recieved for this section did not justify the efforts that was put in by us. Unlike the Design proposal where we were unable to finish the presentation, we were able to finish the presentation in this case, but at the cost of rushing through the whole thing, leaving out multiple details we could have mentioned.<br><br>
                            Another issue was the lack of clarity in what an Interaction Plan was meant to be. I understood that everyone was marked down heavily and believe that there should have been a session regarding what was expected from an Interaction Plan.

                        The map still required quite a bit of work post the MVP presentation.<br><br> 
                        Keeping in mind, Neilsen's Usability Heuristic Principles (Neilsen,2005), I decided to make some design changes to the map.

                            <li><b>Visibility of System Status:</b> I decided to use AJAX to add in a loading GIF to the map so that it allows users to know that the map is loading. The selected filters would also be highlighted in a different shade.</li>
                            <li><b>Match between system and real world:</b> I decided to make use of icons from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/" title="Go to Font Awesome website">Font Awesome iconpack</a> to be present on each filter button so that the 
                                user understands what it stands for. The name of the category also appeared when the mouse is hovered over a button
                            </li>
                            <li><b>Consistency and Standards:</b> All filter buttons were designed to look alike with the help of the <a href="http://danielmontague.com/projects/easyButton.js/v1/examples/" title="Go to EasyButton website">Easy Button plugin</a>. Popups were also designed to have the same layout. </li>
                            <li><b>Aesthetic and Minimalist Design:</b> Easy button along with a minimal color scheme, helped set up an aesthetic look to the map.</li>

                        We were almost 60-70% done by the time of the MVP presentation, hence development of the final product was a bit more relaxed. As a result, we were able to put out almost all the features that we had initially presented during our design proposal. <br><br>
                        Our demo was well recieved by everyone who tested it and it was satisfying to see that our hardwork had paid off. <br><br>
                        We recieved constructive criticism for certain fetaures which could be implemented across future versions. <br><br>

                        We were unable to conduct the user testing amidst the number of users that we were expecting, since there were very less people who came over to our stall.<br><br>
                        Icons for the filters were not perfectly in-line with the category it was meant to represent. This is due to the fact that I had used the free version of the Font Awesome iconpack as opposed to the paid one.<br><br>
                        The Map should have considered using an "AND" condition while filtering while I used an "OR" condition to filter out locations. This was one of the feedback that we recieved. <br><br>
                        The submission of the report coincided with submissions for other courses and as a result, there was a delay in compiling all the required resources. This led to us completing the report, about 15 minutes prior to the submission deadline.

                    <h1>COURSE TAKEAWAYS</h1>
                        <h2>Expectations</h2>
                        <p class="justify">Upon registering for this course, I was intrigued by the prospect of developing an application from scratch. I decided to do DECO7140 in parallel to this course, so I was already sure that I would 
                            have to work twice as hard to not fall behind or prove to be a burden on my teammates. I was also initially daunted by the formation of teams since I thought that my lack of experience in web development would put me at 
                            a disadvantage as compared to others.<br><br>
                            My expectations for this course was to come out with the practical exposure of working on a web-development project as well as expose myself to collaboration in a team environment.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Reflections</h2>
                        <p class="justify">
                            Being an Engineer, I have a knack in coming up with creative solutions for issues faced by people. The absence of an app that allowed you to schedule Barbeque outings in Brisbane was the issue that I looked to tackle in proposing the idea of BBQueue.<br><br>
                            I thoroughly enjoyed my time in this course, and I am grateful to my team Lorem Ipsum for bringing my idea to life. I was never someone who worked according to a schedule but being part of a team made me focus on delivering tasks allocated to me , on time. <br><br>
                            Time Management and Prioritization are personal skills that I picked up over the duration of this course since I wanted to improve my efficiency and succeed in managing my academic workload more effectively.  
                        </p> 
                        <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                        <p class="justify">
                            I believe that developing a fully functional prototype over the course of about 10 weeks is a tough task and would require immense effort put in by all the team members. My suggestions would be to have the Team Charter take place in week 2. This would provide
                            teams, ample time to connect amidst themselves as well as the additional 3 weeks would be immense in the development process.<br><br>
                            I liked how we select certain datasets to develop unique approaches in using the data from them initially for our poster and then compare them amidst our team to select the best idea to move forward with, but I believe that this was unnecessary since it was a simple Pass/Fail Task.
                            I would recommend to either remove this task or form groups at the earliest, possibly adding in this task to be done by the groups. <br><br>
                            Teams were formed with conditions that they required to have an Undergraduate Student as well as Diversity amidst the teammates. Though there is nothing wrong with these criteria, I would focus on ensuring that the group has atleast 1 person who posseses knowledge in Back End development. This was a common course for people from Computer Science, Information Technology 
                            and Interaction design, hence it could be possible to arrange them based on their practical knowledge. This would allow each member to contribute their best towards the team efforts. Our team had a single member who had knowledge in Backend development and I cannot image what we would have done without them.<br><br>
                            We were given 5 minutes to showcase our presentations. This was to ensure that we get accustomed to the "Elevator Style" pitches of the industry. However, in trying to convey all our points as well as provide an interactive experience to the viewers of the presentation,
                            teams would often struggle to wrap everything in under 5 minutes. I would increase this time to 7-8 minutes. Adding to this , would be the recommendation to allow 1 person to take over the presentation. This comes from the fact that more time is consumed when multiple people are presenting.<br><br>
                            There was often a lot of confusion regarding rubrics throughout the course. There were often changes made at the last minute and this was the only downfall of this course. I would recommend to have more attention paid to releasing the final rubrics, well in advance so as to avoid the confusion that we faced during this semester.

                    <h1>PORTFOLIO WEBSITE</h1>
                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p class="justify">
                        This portfolio is designed to document my journey across the DECO7180 Course as well as keep track of my contributions and reflections along the various stages of developing BBQueue.
                        This website has been developed using HTML,CSS and Javascript.
                        Content present on the website has been curated by me and is a compilation of notes that I have been accumulating throughout the semester.
                        I have made the Introduction banner using Adobe Photoshop and the slideshow has been implemented by a tutorial provided by Ho Viet Hoang (Ho&agrave;ng, 2023).
                        Images across this website have alt text as well as a title, which appears on hovering over them.
                        Every Link that is present on this website has a title and is visually different as compared to other text content. This can be observed by the different color as well as the change of the mouse cursor to a pointer upon hovering over a clickable link.<br><br>
                        Future improvements to this portfolio include making it responsive as well as mobile friendly.<br><br>
                        Overall, I was able to learn a lot from working on BBQueue and had a chance to reflect upon my work over the past 3 months while compiling this portfolio website.
